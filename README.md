### Hi, I’m Andy Roberts, a Cloud Engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand!

I’m interested in all things Cloud, Automation, Infrastructure As Code, anything and everything cloud related really!  I mainly work on the DevOps and Infrastructure side of Azure so spend a lot of my time with automating builds with Terraform, Powershell, Azure CLI, Azure DevOps & GitHub as well as spending A LOT of time with Kubernetes!  I'm active in the [#CloudFamily](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CloudFamily) community helping out fellow Cloud Engineers whenever I can.

I also blog about my adventures in cloud to help the community!
